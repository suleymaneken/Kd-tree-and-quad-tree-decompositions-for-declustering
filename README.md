# Kd-tree-and-quad-tree-decompositions-for-declustering

<p>Kd tree, Quad tree, Space partitioning, Spatial indexing, Range queries, Query optimization</p>
<p>This repository contains datasets and Java code to to show the possibility of using two well-known space partitioning and indexing techniques, kd trees and quad trees, in declustering applications to increase input/output (I/O) parallelization and reduce spatial data processing times.
